## IndoorLocation Open-Source Framework

Indoor Location is an open-source framework that aims at simplifying the connection of any indoor positioning technology to the Mapwize Indoor Maps.

The entire framework is still in beta and lots of components are still missing. Please feel free to contact us at <indoorlocation@mapwize.io> to know more about the roadmap and influence it. We are always looking for feedback.

If you are an Indoor Location Provider and would like to connect to Mapwize, please get in touch at <indoorlocation@mapwize.io>.
